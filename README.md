# Myopia Theme for GTK+

![](.screenshots/screenshot.png)

## Warning

This is a work in progress.

The blur doesn't work, it uses transparency only.

This theme is based on Adwaita, for now, it only works "well" overriding Adwaita's css.

## Installation

### Overriding Theme

For now, I'd only recommend using the Overriding Theme.

To use you need to have the Adwaita Dark theme installed and selected, this theme will override some code of it.

To install it, copy the 'gtk.css' file on the 'Overriding Theme' folder and paste it on '.config/gtk-3.0/' replacing the old gtk.css file.

### The Real Theme

To install, copy one of the themes on the 'Themes' folder and paste it on '~/.themes', and select the theme in Gnome Tweaks.

## Notes

The formal version of the theme needs lots of work, the overriding theme has lots of issues but it was the first that worked, soon it'll be discontinued and totally replaced with the real theme.

### Donate! 

Making this theme real and good takes a lot of time of designing and coding. So if you like the project, consider donating to keep me motivated maintaining it :)
